# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Jinansh

I'm a data scientist with a strong background in finance and a passion for helping the environment. I enjoy building tools using new technologies and love to tell stories through data.

## What I do
- Data Science & Analytics: I love working with data, building models, and generating actionable insights to drive decision-making. Some of my recent work involves building prediction models and analytics dashboards.
- Full-Stack Development: I build efficient and scalable applications using technologies like Python, FastAPI, Firebase, and React, among others.
- Storytelling with Data: Data is more than numbersâ€”it's about translating it into a story. I enjoy uncovering meaningful insights and presenting them in a way that's easy to understand and impactful.

## Featured Projects
While some of my larger projects are private due to client confidentiality (and API keys not properly configured), here's a glimpse of the type of work I do:
